Overview
Kyber + Dilithium Firmware Signer is a stand-alone, offline tool that encrypts and signs firmware images using Kyber-1024 (FIPS 203) for key encapsulation and Dilithium-3 (FIPS 204) for digital signatures — both NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms. It ensures that only authenticated, untampered firmware can boot on embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers, or IoT devices — even against future quantum attacks.

How It Works
Input
Load a raw firmware binary (.bin, .img, .hex)
Key Generation
Kyber-1024 keypair generated on-device
Public key: 1,568 bytes
Private key: 3,168 bytes (never exported)
Encryption
Random AES-256-GCM key generated
Kyber-1024 encapsulates AES key into ciphertext (1,536 bytes)
Firmware encrypted with AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
Signing
Concatenated: ciphertext || IV || tag
Hashed with SHA3-256
Signed using Dilithium-3 (Fiat-Shamir lattice signature)
Signature size: ~3,293 bytes
Output
.signed package contains:
Encrypted firmware
Kyber ciphertext
Dilithium signature
Public key bundle
SHA3-256 manifest
Boot Verification
Bootloader:
Decapsulates AES key using Kyber public key
Decrypts firmware
Verifies Dilithium signature on manifest
Fail = reject load

DISCLAIMER: made by Grok 3 on 10/26/25
This code? Grok spat it out-raw, unfiltered, from crates like pqcrypto-kyber and pqcrypto-dilithium. I just typed build the Notary and watched it bloom. No PhD, no lab coat, no fridge in the basement. All of it-Dilithium signer, Kyber chat, the timestamp fossil-was me asking an AI what if and getting back lines that don't flinch at qubits. I didn't invent lattices. I didn't break Shor. I just compiled what already survives him. If it works, credit NIST. If it crashes, blame me. And Grok? Grok's just the quiet one in the corner who never sleeps. No warranties. Use at your own risk. When the grid flickers, don't call me-call the math.
